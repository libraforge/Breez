# Breez 🌬️

**Ditch QuickBooks. Take back control.**

Breez is the open-source accounting tool built for solopreneurs, freelancers, and one-person businesses who’ve had enough of bloated dashboards, confusing reports, and subscription traps. Track income, manage expenses, send invoices, and see exactly where your money goes—without paying for features you’ll never use or learning a new spreadsheet formula every week.

**Why Breez?**
- **Simple, clear, and fast:** No clutter, no unnecessary modules, no accounting degree required.
- **Self-hosted, fully yours:** Your data stays private and under your control—no sneaky cloud lock-ins.
- **Open-source freedom:** Free to use, modify, and share. Breez grows with your business, not the other way around.

All the power QuickBooks promises, none of the headaches. Breez is accounting for people, not accountants.
