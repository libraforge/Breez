# Contributing to Breez

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Breez. Early feedback and real-world usage are shaping the project more than anything else right now.

## How you can help today (and it really matters)

At this stage, the most valuable contributions are:

- Bug reports  
- Feature ideas and product feedback  
- UX and usability observations  
- Self-hosting experiences and edge cases  
- Documentation gaps or unclear parts  

These directly influence the direction and priorities of Breez.

Please use:

- **Issues** for bugs, feature requests, or concrete improvement ideas  
- **Discussions** for broader feedback, questions, or exploratory thoughts  

If you’re unsure where something belongs, open an Issue anyway. We’ll sort it out.

## About code contributions

Breez is still evolving quickly, and we’re actively stabilizing the core architecture. Because of this, we’re **not accepting pull requests yet**.

This isn’t a “no forever”. Once the foundations settle, we’ll open the door to code contributions and clearly document how to get involved.
